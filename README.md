# Model Mastery Workshops

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft-foundry/model-mastery)

A growing series of **3-4 hr, self-guided technical workshops** that teach you how to ship production-grade AI applications on **Microsoft Foundry** — one model family at a time. Workshops target **L200–L400** learners (comfortable with Python, terminals, and cloud basics) and are designed for both live delivery and asynchronous self-paced study.

Each workshop is opinionated about the same end-to-end arc so the muscle memory transfers from one model family to the next:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Setup** | Provision a Foundry project, deploy the models the workshop needs, and verify your environment from GitHub Codespaces. |
| **Build** | Implement a realistic scenario (often an agent) using the model family's flagship capabilities through Foundry's SDKs. |
| **Explore** | Go deeper on the model family's specialised capabilities (embeddings, rerank, tool use, long context, vision, etc.) and connect them back to the scenario. |

## Workshops in the series

| # | Workshop | Model family | Status | Start here |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Anthropic on Foundry** | Claude family | ☑️ WIP | [`anthropic/`](./anthropic/) |
| 2 | **Cohere on Foundry** | Command A Plus, Embed v4, Rerank v4 | ✅ Ready | [`cohere/README.md`](./cohere/README.md) |
| 3 | **Intro To Foundry** | Cross-model platform features | ☑️ WIP  | [`foundry/`](./foundry/) |

> Each workshop is fully self-contained. You can start with whichever model family you care about — there are no cross-workshop prerequisites.

## What's in a workshop folder

Every workshop follows the same top-level shape so you always know where to look:

```text
<model-family>/
├── README.md            # workshop overview — start here
├── sample.env           # canonical environment-variable reference
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies for the workshop
├── lab-0-setup/         # provisioning + env wiring (Codespaces-first)
├── lab-1-<scenario>/    # build a realistic application with the flagship model
└── lab-2-<deep-dive>/   # explore the model family's specialised capabilities
```

Open the workshop's `README.md` first — it links to `lab-0-setup/SETUP.md`, which walks you through provisioning in roughly 15–20 minutes.

> 📝 **Environment variables.** Every workshop ships a `sample.env` in its top-level folder that documents every variable the labs read (Foundry endpoint, deployment names, API keys, optional load-test knobs, etc.). Lab 0's `setup-env.sh` copies it to `.env` and fills in concrete values for you. Read `sample.env` first whenever you want to know what a workshop expects to find in its environment.

## Prerequisites (common to all workshops)

- An Azure subscription with permission to create a Foundry account, project, and model deployments.
- GitHub Codespaces (recommended) or a local environment with Python 3.11+ and the Azure CLI.
- Familiarity with Jupyter notebooks and the Python ecosystem.

Each workshop's `lab-0-setup/SETUP.md` lists any model-family-specific extras (regions, quotas, SDK versions).

## Contributing

The workshops live side-by-side so improvements to one (notebook style, evaluator patterns, tracing setup, Codespaces hardening) can flow easily to the others. If you spot a gap or an inconsistency between workshops, open an issue or PR against the affected `<model-family>/` folder.
