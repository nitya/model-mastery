"""Factory helpers for the local multi-agent travel concierge.

This module wires four Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) ``Agent`` instances:

* ``flight_agent`` — searches and books flights using the the workshop's booking tools.
* ``hotel_agent`` — searches and books hotels.
* ``car_agent`` — searches and books rental cars.
* ``concierge`` — orchestrator that delegates to the three specialists by
  calling them as tools.

All four agents share a single :class:`OpenAIChatClient` pointed at the
Cohere Command A Plus deployment in your Microsoft Foundry project. MAF lets you
build this with an open-source framework using a model deployed in Foundry —
the client calls the account-level ``/openai/v1`` endpoint exposed by your
Foundry account, which serves both the chat completions and responses APIs.

    The lab uses MAF's ``OpenAIChatClient`` with the Foundry account-level

    This matches the inference pattern Microsoft Foundry shows on the model
    card and is more reliable than the project-scoped Responses API path used
    by Foundry's project-scoped ``FoundryChatClient``: the project-scoped path can return 404
    "Project not found" / "DeploymentNotFound" for many minutes after a fresh
    project is provisioned, and even after propagation completes it returns
    intermittent 404s at the service layer. The account-level path avoids
    both issues.
