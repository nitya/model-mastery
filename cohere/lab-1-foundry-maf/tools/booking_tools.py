"""Mock booking tools for Lab 1's enterprise travel concierge agent.

The functions in this module deliberately use local JSON catalogs instead of live
supplier APIs. In the workshop, Foundry exposes their signatures and docstrings
to Command A Plus as function-calling tools, then the notebook executes the selected
Python function client-side and sends the result back to the agent.
